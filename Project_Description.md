### Group-based project

[Group-based project](# "Alternative formats")

The purpose of the project is to design, simulate and build a temperature sensor system. The project counts 30 % of the grade in the course.

Requirements:

* The temperature sensor shall be based on a Pt1000 element (art. no: 00692527,see specifications [here](https://www.elfadistrelec.no/no/pt-1000-temperatursensor-med-rtd-platinabrikke-70-300-jumo-00692527/p/30186121)). (I have the sensor devices on my office, give me a notice when you need one).
* The resistance change in the temperature element shall be converted to a voltage.
* The voltage should be converted to digital values.
* The temperature should be presented for instance on a display.
* The sensor can be divided into two devices with wireless communication in between.
* The sensor should be powered from a battery.

Practical information:

* Each group shall consist of 1-3 students.
* The project shall be documented in a report based (templates given below) with a maximum of four pages exclusive appendixes. The report shall be written in either Norwegian or English.
* Use components that can be found in ELFA, Farnell or RS Components.
* Send information of the components you need to buy to PÃ¥l Erik Endrerud by using the Excel-sheet in [Norwegian](https://ntnu.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2116704-dt-content-rid-61172609_1/xid-61172609_1) [![Click for more options](https://learn.content.blackboardcdn.com/3900.74.0-rel.24+82f257c/images/ci/icons/cmlink_generic.gif)](#contextMenu "Click for more options")  or in [English](https://ntnu.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2116704-dt-content-rid-61172608_1/xid-61172608_1) [![Click for more options](https://learn.content.blackboardcdn.com/3900.74.0-rel.24+82f257c/images/ci/icons/cmlink_generic.gif)](#contextMenu "Click for more options")

Submissions:

* Early draft delivered in BlackBoard before Sunday 8. October at 23:59 containing:

  * The design of the electrical interface of the sensor (circuit diagram)
  * Pictures of simulations of the circuit (from MultiSim, LTSpice, etc.)
  * Parts list of critical components

* Demonstration of the group project takes place at Thursday 23. November from 10:15 in B104.

* Deadline for final group report in pdf-format in inspera: **Friday 24. November at 15:00**.\
  (Only necessary that one in the group deliver. Can submit several times, but the last submission is valid).
